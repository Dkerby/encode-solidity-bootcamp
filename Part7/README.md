# IPFS Storage Demo

This project uses the 'ipfs' npm package to store and retrieve data from IPFS. It it only a simple demo, not intended to be a full production ready-solution.

In order to run the express.js API and access the vanilla HTML/JS frontend, run the following commands below. The UI will be accessible at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) after running. Bootstrap was used for styling.

```
cd ipfs-api
npm i
npm start
```
